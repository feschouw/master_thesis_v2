# Thesis: Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series using Temporal Fusion Transformers

This repository explores the use of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) for causal discovery in multivariate time series data. Key research areas include evaluating the built-in variable importance mechanism, validating causal relationships using Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and incorporating prediction uncertainty to improve accuracy and reliability. The project focuses on identifying causal structures, measuring effectiveness with F1 scores, and comparing TFT to other causal discovery methods.
